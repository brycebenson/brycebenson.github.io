    <p class="main__copy">Chubb was interested in transforming the experience of reading an expansive chart within a PDF into a PWA hooked into their CMS -- allowing field agents an installable resource with offline data through service workers.<!--readmore--> The experience is powered by React, React Router, and Redux to handle state while the layouts are built with Flexbox and CSS columns. The app fetches data from the backend's API and Redux maps state to props to populate the content.</p>
