        <p class="main__copy">I have been fascinated by computers and the web since I first powered up the family Power Mac. My interest in development just made sense; I always wanted to work with the internet and being able to craft designs into beautiful, intuitive websites is what I aim to do.</p>
        <p class="main__copy">I received a degree in Writing & Rhetoric in New Media which laid the groundwork for my exposure into web development and theory behind digital communication.</p>
        <p class="main__copy">Responsive design and development is not just a buzzword, it's something that impacts lives of all internet users on a daily basis. I strive for clean, BEM-inspired, low-specificity object-oriented CSS and semantic, accessible markup to create a web that is for everyone on any device.</p>
        <p class="main__copy">Utilizing build tools like gulp, I prefer to automate common tasks like prefixing, Sass compiling, style/script concatenation and minification, and crushing images as well as keeping server parity in development with vagrant, composer, and ansible.</p>
